MLB Project by Perla Lucaboni

The main work is contained in the file `MLB_project.ipynb`. I recommend importing it into **Google Colab** to take advantage of the integration with **Google Drive**.

All file paths for the trained models are specified assuming they are stored on Google Drive. Therefore, to use the models, you will need to upload them to your own Drive.

**Note:** The file `model_cnn_simple.zip` was uploaded as a ZIP archive because it exceeds GitHubâ€™s 100 MB file size limit.

The repository also includes several `.csv` files that track the training progress of the various models.
